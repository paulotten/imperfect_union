http://cliffle.com/p/dangerust/4/ "A More Perfect Union" presents "accessors" as safe abstractions to unions.

As lines 215 and onward of src/main.rs demonstrate, this is not the case.

Note: If you want to run this program you need to pass it a number of iterations to run. As I have added some debug output I would recommend this be a low number (unless you remove that line first).
